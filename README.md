Mastering the topics covered in this project is essential for a strong foundation in the Common Core. The Piscine Reloaded reinforces key C concepts that will appear throughout the curriculum, such as:

  - Memory management (allocation, freeing memory)

  - String and array manipulation

  - Recursion and loops

  - Basic algorithms and logic structuring

Achieving a perfect grade ensures a deep understanding of these fundamentals, making future projects smoother and more efficient. If you're preparing for the Common Core, I highly recommend aiming for 100% completion on this project! 💡

## 🎯 Tips for Piscine Reloaded

    ✅ Read the instructions carefully – Small details can make a big difference.
    ✅ Avoid forbidden libraries – Some functions, like printf(), may be restricted in certain exercises.
    ✅ Use norminette frequently – Ensuring your code follows 42’s rules helps avoid rework.
    ✅ Test extensively – Use a variety of inputs to catch unexpected errors.
    ✅ Comment your code – This makes it easier to understand when reviewing later.
    ✅ Ask for help, but understand the solution – Collaboration is key, but make sure you grasp every concept.
